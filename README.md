This project contains a real time connection for the canvas using Firebase real time database.It also contains different features for controlling shapes with the main resizing/moving feature which is implemented from scratch with a generic way to resize/move different shapes by just implementing one function.Another important feature is the plugins feature for developers you can import a jar plugin in during run time using java-reflection and dynamic linkage design pattern.
